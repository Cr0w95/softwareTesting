            <h2>Software Development Life Cycle </h2>
            <p>The SDLC is an acronym for Software Development Life Cycle. The SDLC is a design and structure meant to develop software. It is the most efficient way of testing products.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p id="linkDetail"> Planning
                A customer will have an idea for the app, with the money to get this idea off the ground. The customer will find a good tech company to develop this project, then meet with the product owner/project manager. They'll discuss the terms and sign a deal to get started.
                </p>
            
            <h3>Requirement Analysis</h3>
            <p>The customer and product owner will agree on requirements (such as login and logout interface, the structure of the website/app) before bringing in a team to make it all happen. This team is made up of operations, developers, automation, and testers. They will all discuss the requirements needed to create this application. The project manager will create tickets for all the requirements.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Design </h3>
            <p>Takes all requirements to start designing the product. Page layouts, code languages, needed browsers, and many more.</p><br>
            <h3>Implementation/ Coding</h3>
            <p>This is where all groups of the team put their skills together to start the application. The operations team will set up the hardware, developers will write the code, the designers will create the user interface, and the testers will analyze the requirements and write test cases to catch early flaws the application may have.
            </p>
            <h3>Testing </h3>
            <p>Make sure all the requirements have been met. Ensure all functions work correctly, finds all bugs that weren't caught beforehand (which is important because these issues arise frequently) all bugs get sent to a tracking system, this is where developers come back and fix these issues. This process is called a “bug life cycle”</p>
            <h3>Deployment </h3>
            <p>The operations team will get the application ready for release/production. Adding what hardware and servers that may be needed so that this application/ website may be used to the intended market.</p>
            <h3>Maintenance </h3>
            <p>If there is an issue once released users send emails where maintenance will fix issues such as login logout functions.</p>
