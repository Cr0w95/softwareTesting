            <p id="linkDetail">When talking about software testing some people tend to argue between what's better, Manual testing, or automated testing? </p>
            <br>
            <p>Although the name of these two testing groups gives it away, we will be breaking it down into more detail in this page. We will talk about what is automated testing, what is manual testing, and provide a graph in the end from <a href="https://www.guru99.com/manual-testing.html">Guru99</a>.</p>

            <h3>Auto Testing</h3>

            <p>What is automated testing? Automated-testing is when you are using an automated tool to execute a test on the software you have. The advantage of automated software testing is that the machine can also enter test data it has received. Some automated tests can compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports. Test Automation demands considerable investments of money and resources.</p>

            <p>You may ask yourself but why automated testing? Here are some reasons to consider automated testing. Automated testing is faster is less expensive than manual testing it is also It is difficult to test for multilingual sites manually. Aautomated-testing also reduces the number of errors a manual test could have. </p>
         
            <h3>Manual Testing</h3>

            <p>Manual testing is when software testers manually test software, apps, or projects without the use of any automated help. The purpose of conducting these tests is to find any bugs the developers may have in their program. The tester then has to write down specific notes so that the development team can take care of the issue.</p>

            <p>After the report has been sent to the development team, another test has to be carried out. Due to the fact, another test has to be conducted, the price goes up. Thus making manual testing more expensive.Some examples of manual testing would include Black Box Testing White Box Testing, Unit Testing, System Testing, Integration Testing, and Acceptance Testing. </p>
